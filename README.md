# Using Leaflet to visualize earthquake data
In this assignment I built a map visualizing earthquake data collected from the following source: (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). I used the Leaflet library to plot each earthquake location on a map of the globe. Each earthquake location is symbolized by a circle that is colored according to the depth of that earthquake. There is a legend available to interpret the color coding. Additionally, each circle is sized according to the magnitude of that earthquake (the larger the circle, the larger the magnitude). Each marker can be clicked on to display a pop-up that contains that earthquakes location and exact magnitude and depth. The map also has a display option for the style of viewing, as well as an optional display of the Earth's tectonic plates.
